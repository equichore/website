      <p class=" ">You’ve done your best to assign chores to other <span class="purple" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Choremates are household members, adult or child,  who participate in the completion of chores">Choremates</span> and they’re doing them. According to the other choremates and the charts and graphs on Equichore, all the housework has been divvied up equitably. But, at the end of the day you still feel like you’ve been doing most of the cleaning and you’re mentally and physically spent! Why is that?</p>
      <p class="">Well friends, it’s all those little things.</p>
      <p>You just automatically grabbed that basket of laundry on your way downstairs because it’s there and it needed to go down.</p>
      <p>What about those 3 empty cups that were sitting on the coffee table next to the pile of used kleenex your sniffly partner left?  You grabbed all those and deposited them in the kitchen en route to the bathroom even though none of them were yours.</p>
      <p>What of the 50 lego-landmines on the floor this morning? Where are they now? Surely the magical house-keeping fairy waved her wand and *poofed* them away. Or, the house’s auto-clean feature kicked in and they made it back into their designated receptacle through the marvels of modern technology. Or...and this one’s the most implausible...the kids picked them up without being asked.</p>
      <p>Nope, it was you again. Once your foot painfully alerted you to the legos presence while wrapping up a business call, you immediately cleared them away without even wincing. Your client on the call, as well as your other choremates, were never alerted to your epidural-worthy levels of pain or the record-setting speed in which you cleared the lego-minefield.</p>
      <p>In all these instances, you didn’t even think about it, you just did it. Why? More importantly, why you?</p>
      <h2 class=" logo text-center">Because it had to be done.</h2>
      <p>There are definitely many, many more things you do in a day than what has been documented and assigned in Equichore or, acknowledged by the other choremates. It’s those little things that keep your household comfortable and functional. Because you do them so automatically, you may not have given the other choremates or even, yourself a chance to realize they’re being done.</p>
      <p>So why are you the one doing these things? This is a complicated question. Likely, it’s because you’re the Chorehorse of the household. Sometimes, it’s because one or more members of the household suffers from a bad case of the “No-See-Ums”. Other times, and this is the saddest scenario, your other choremates are fine the way things are and will let you continue to do all these things. Usually, It can just seem easier to quickly do it yourself than expend the energy and bad feelings nagging the chore-slacking household member to do it.</p>
      <h2 class=" logo text-center">How can Equichore help?</h2>
      <p>It’s unrealistic to create individual tasks within Equichore for all the little things. It would take far more time trying to document these things and your time is far too valuable for that. However, you need to have your contributions acknowledged. How can you make that happen without causing you more work?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Equichore has created a task called, “Little things”. You can add/subtract the amount of time you think you cumulatively spent doing all those little things and add it to your task list and mark it complete. If you want to see if there’s a pattern to these “little things”, you have the option of adding more details to the task for later analysis. This way, you’ll get credit in Equichore’s totals for your contributions and get quantitative data with which to potentially assign tasks to others more equitably in the future.</li>
        <li>Every once and awhile, especially while you’re stewing about how unappreciated and tired you are, open up the Equichore app and add a type of “Bulk Task” as a new chore. You may only have to do this once. Add/subtract the amount of time you think you cumulatively spent doing all this task and add it along with any other details to help you track it in the future.</li>
        <li>Have a respectful conversation with the other choremates illustrating where things were/were not done by them which resulted in you being the one to do this chore and how it made you feel. In fairness to them, they may not have realized they did it or how it made you feel. Be specific in your examples and give them a chance to find solutions. If you’ve been able to add “little things” tasks to your completed chores over  time, you can use this to illustrate your point of view.</li>
        <li>Discuss the “No-See-Ums” with the other choremates. The “No-See-Ums” aren’t necessarily caused by other choremates' lack of attention or bad intentions so be sure to acknowledge that when starting the conversation. But, the other choremates  have the ability to complete these little tasks also if only their eyes could see it and their brains register it as a task that needs to be done. By bringing their attention to specific “No-See-Ums”, it may cease to be unseen and therefore, no longer your task to complete alone.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We don’t have all the answers to solve your unique household’s inequitable task distribution. But, know that you’re not alone in this issue. It would be great to hear ways in which you’ve used Equichore to make your household’s task distribution more equitable. Please share how you’ve successfully reached purple with us! Your experience can help others achieve purple as well.</p>
